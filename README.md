# WebScraping

Web scraping can be performed in multiple way. Three wildly used python modules for web scraping are Scrapy, BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
You can use either of these or combination of these.

Install the packages listed in the requirements.txt   
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want to use Selenium, download the web driver for the browser which you are using and add it to the path.
